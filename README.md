# FRONTEND CODING INTERVIEW QUESTION 2

This repository will address the following project requirements:

"2. Create a PhotoGallery component.
You can either use the same project as above and expand on your own webpack config, or create a new project using React's "Create React App" from https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app.
The PhotoGallery component should take in an array of images.
Each image will have a url and a caption.
The captions should be displayed over the image.
The PhotoGallery should allow users to either click or swipe through images.
Smoothly animate the swipe and transition between images.
Handle any edge cases you can think of.

Please commit your code incrementally, so we can follow your thinking."
